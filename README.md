# fios2

A reimplementation of libSceFios2.prx, which is present in all PS4 games, and is used to interface with psarc archive files. This project isn't attempting to emulate it as is, instead opting to "fake" the archives with their unpacked versions, allowing for much easier modding. Currently, it is barely not unusable, and can be used in a select few games such as Gravity Rush Remastered to varying degrees of success (some things work, some don't)
